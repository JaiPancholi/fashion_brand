# Image Classification on Fashion Sites
## Project Plan
1. First collect a lot of image data across many different fashion sites

2. Label the images by clustering the same person aross a brand so that we can say uniqilo-a for all images of a single model featured on uniqlo, uniqlo-b for another person etc. Some unsupervised approach is needed.

3. Find Eigenfaces across the dataset - attempt to show the distinction between brands and who they cast

4. Build a predictor method to take in a new picture and classify them into a brand.
